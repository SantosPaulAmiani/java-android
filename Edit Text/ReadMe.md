EditText Example
This is a simple Android application that demonstrates how to use an EditText, which is an input control that allows users to enter and edit text.

Overview
The app contains a single activity, MainActivity, with an EditText control. When the user enters text in the EditText, the app displays the entered text in a TextView in real-time using a TextWatcher.

Requirements
To run this application, you need:

Android Studio (version 4.0 or later)
Android device or emulator with Android OS (version 4.0 or later)
Getting Started
Clone the repository or download the project as a zip file.

Open Android Studio and choose "Open an Existing Project."

Navigate to the project directory and select the "EditTextExample" folder.

Wait for the project to sync and build.

Connect your Android device to the computer or launch an Android emulator.

Click on the "Run" button in Android Studio, or use the shortcut Shift + F10, to build and run the app on the connected device or emulator.

Usage
When the app is launched, the main activity will be displayed, showing an EditText and a TextView. As you type or modify text in the EditText, the TextView will display the entered text in real-time.

Code Explanation
The EditText and TextView are defined in the layout XML file (activity_main.xml). The EditText captures the user's input, and a TextWatcher is used to monitor changes in the EditText. When the user enters or modifies text, the onTextChanged method is triggered, updating the TextView with the entered text.
