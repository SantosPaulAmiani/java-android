Spinner Example
This is a simple Android application that demonstrates how to use a Spinner, which is a drop-down menu for selecting an item from a list of options.

Overview
The app contains a single activity, MainActivity, with a Spinner control that allows the user to select one option from a list of items. When an option is selected, a toast message displays the selected item.

Requirements
To run this application, you need:

Android Studio (version 4.0 or later)
Android device or emulator with Android OS (version 4.0 or later)
Getting Started
Clone the repository or download the project as a zip file.

Open Android Studio and choose "Open an Existing Project."

Navigate to the project directory and select the "SpinnerExample" folder.

Wait for the project to sync and build.

Connect your Android device to the computer or launch an Android emulator.

Click on the "Run" button in Android Studio, or use the shortcut Shift + F10, to build and run the app on the connected device or emulator.

Usage
When the app is launched, the main activity will be displayed, showing the Spinner control. Tap on the Spinner to open the drop-down list, and select an option from the list. A toast message will show the selected item.

Code Explanation
The Spinner control is defined in the layout XML file (activity_main.xml). The options for the Spinner are defined in the Java code (MainActivity.java) using an array of strings. The ArrayAdapter is used to populate the Spinner with the options. When an option is selected from the Spinner, the onItemSelected method is triggered, displaying a toast message with the selected item.
