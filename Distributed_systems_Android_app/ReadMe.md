This code creates a simple Android application that allows the user to send a request to a server. The server then returns a response, which is displayed in the application. The code is written in Java, and it uses the Java Socket class to implement the communication between the client and the server.

To run the code, you will need to compile it using the following command:

./gradlew assembleDebug
Then, you can run the application on an Android device or emulator using the following command:

adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
When you run the application, you will see a text field where you can enter a request. When you click on the "Send" button, the request will be sent to the server. The server will then generate a response and send it back to the application. The response will be displayed in the text view.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
