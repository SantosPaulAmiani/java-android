<h1>SERVER</h1>

This code creates a simple Android application that acts as a server. 

The server listens for incoming requests from clients. 

When a request is received, the server generates a response and sends it back to the client. 

The code is written in Java, and it uses the Java ServerSocket class to implement the server.

To run the code, you will need to compile it using the following command:

./gradlew assembleDebug

Then, you can run the application on an Android device or emulator using the following command:

adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

When you run the application, the server will start listening for incoming requests. 

When a request is received, the server will generate a response and send it back to the client. 

The response will be displayed in the text view.


<h1>CLIENT</h1>

This code creates a simple Android application that allows the user to send a request to a server. 

The server then returns a response, which is displayed in the application. 

The code is written in Java, and it uses the Java Socket class to implement the communication between the client and the server.

To run the code, you will need to compile it using the following command:

./gradlew assembleDebug

Then, you can run the application on an Android device or emulator using the following command:

adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

When you run the application, you will see a text field where you can enter a request. 

When you click on the "Send" button, the request will be sent to the server. 

The server will then generate a response and send it back to the application. 

The response will be displayed in the text view.
